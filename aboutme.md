What most people don't know is that psychology students like me don't have a goatbeard and also we really don't talk about Oedipus all day like Freud did. For the surprise of most people we are talking about p-values and principal component analyses.

And so I became **interested in statistic, data science, machine learning and obviously in GNU R**, which is the first programming language I've learned yet (very proud of it).
There is a great dispute about the use of statistic in psychology under students, because many don't believe that we shouldn't break down the complexity of human kind into number or models. 

In my opinion **statistic is a toolbox from which we can take tools for our research or work and use it to proof our beliefs**. But it is very dangerous when we arrange our beliefs because of statistic methods. There can be some effects or true thesis although you can't test it with an ANOVA.

Another important point for me is that statistic isn't a static building like many people think. You can discuss about almost every method and their usabilities. There are some main discussions which are guiding the development of statistical ideas for more than 50 years, like the use of p-values in research or the use of Bayesian-Statistic. So there is no black and white in statistic and it is important to know the benefits and disadvantages of specific methods, because wrong done statistic have a deep impact on many people lives e.g. the development of a psychological therapy program.

I hope you could get an idea about my point of view and maybe you are interested about my posts in which I try to create some introduction in some interesting themes or ideas. Because I'm just at the start of my journey through data science, statistic and R, I will do some faults and so I'm happy if you help me!

Thanks very much and have a nice day
